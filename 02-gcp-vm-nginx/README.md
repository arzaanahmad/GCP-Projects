# Project: Creating a Virtual Machine on Google Cloud

## Objective
To create and access a Virtual Machine (VM) on Google Cloud for learning and practice.

## Services Used
- Compute Engine (Virtual Machine)
- VPC Network
- Firewall rules (HTTP/SSH)

## Steps I Followed
1. Created a new VM in Compute Engine.
2. Selected region and machine type.
3. Allowed HTTP and HTTPS traffic.
4. Connected to the VM using SSH.
5. (Optional) Installed Nginx to run a web server.

## Proof (Screenshots)
- vm-create-page.png → VM configuration page  
- vm-created.png → VM successfully created  
- vm-ssh.png → SSH access to VM  
- nginx-running.png → Web server running on VM

## What I Learned
- How to create and manage a VM in GCP.
- How to connect using SSH.
- How firewall rules affect access.
- How public IP works.

## Next Step
I will try to:
- Stop and restart the VM  
- Create another VM  
- Deploy a small web app
