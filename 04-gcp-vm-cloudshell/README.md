# Project: Create and Manage VM Instances Using Cloud Shell

## Objective
To create, list, and manage Virtual Machines in Google Cloud using Cloud Shell (command line) instead of the web console.

## Services Used
- Google Compute Engine
- Google Cloud Shell
- gcloud CLI

## What I Did
1. Opened Google Cloud Shell.
2. Listed existing VM instances using gcloud command.
3. Created a new VM using Cloud Shell.
4. Verified the VM in Compute Engine console.
5. (Optional) Stopped or deleted the VM using Cloud Shell.

## Commands Used
(See commands.txt file)

## Proof (Screenshots)
- cloudshell-open.png → Cloud Shell opened in GCP
- cloudshell-list-vms.png → Listing VMs using gcloud
- cloudshell-create-vm.png → Creating VM via Cloud Shell
- cloudshell-vm-created.png → VM visible in Compute Engine
- cloudshell-delete-vm.png → Deleting/Stopping VM via Cloud Shell

## What I Learned
- How to use Cloud Shell for cloud operations.
- How gcloud commands work.
- Difference between using UI vs command line.
- How to manage VMs faster with CLI.

## Next Steps
- Try creating a VM with custom machine type.
- Try creating a VM in a different region.
